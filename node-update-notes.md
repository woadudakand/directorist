# Node.js Version Update Notes

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING
Node.js 22.x is currently in development and not yet released for production use. It is recommended to use Node.js 20.x (LTS) for production environments. This update should only be used for development/testing purposes.

## Current Status
- Previous Node.js version: 16.13.2
- Target Node.js version: 22.15.0 (Development Version)
- Previous npm version: 8.1.2
- Recommended npm version for Node.js 22.x: 10.x

## Package Compatibility Notes

### Dependencies that need attention:
1. `node-sass` (v7.0.1) - This package is deprecated and may have compatibility issues with Node.js 22.x. Should be replaced with `sass`
2. `vue` (v2.6.11) - Using Vue 2.x, which is still supported but not the latest version
3. `vuex` (v3.5.1) - Using Vuex 3.x, which is compatible with Vue 2.x
4. `webpack` (v4.46.0) - Webpack 4.x may have significant compatibility issues with Node.js 22.x
5. `@babel/core` (v7.10.5) - Should be updated to latest 7.x version for better Node.js 22.x compatibility
6. `webpack-dev-server` (v3.11.0) - Should be updated to latest 3.x version for Node.js 22.x compatibility

### Breaking Changes to Consider:
- Node.js 22.x is a development version and may introduce breaking changes
- Some native modules might need to be rebuilt
- The `node-sass` package must be replaced with `sass` before updating
- Webpack 4.x might not be fully compatible with Node.js 22.x
- Some dependencies might need to be updated to their latest versions

## Update Steps
1. Update Node.js version in package.json to 22.15.0
2. Update npm version to 10.x (recommended for Node.js 22.x)
3. Replace `node-sass` with `sass` in dependencies
4. Update other dependencies to their latest compatible versions

## Required Actions
1. First, replace `node-sass` with `sass`:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall node-sass
   npm install sass --save
   ```
2. Update npm to version 10.x:
   ```bash
   npm install -g npm@10
   ```
3. Clean npm cache and node_modules:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm package-lock.json
   ```
4. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Testing Notes
After updating, run the following commands to ensure everything works:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run prod
```

### What to Test:
1. All build processes
2. Development server
3. Production builds
4. All Vue components
5. All webpack configurations
6. All npm scripts
7. Any native modules or addons

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, you can rollback to Node.js 20.x (LTS):
1. Install Node.js 20.x
2. Restore the previous package.json
3. Run `npm install`
4. Verify all functionality

## Future Considerations
1. Consider using Node.js 20.x (LTS) for production environments
2. Plan to migrate from Vue 2.x to Vue 3.x
3. Consider upgrading to Webpack 5.x
4. Update all dependencies to their latest stable versions
5. Consider using TypeScript more extensively
6. Review and update build configurations for better performance

## Alternative Recommendation
For production environments, it is strongly recommended to use Node.js 20.x (LTS) instead of 22.x. The LTS version provides better stability and compatibility with existing packages.
